This is the first one. I biking back from the library where I would apply for jobs because I also didn't have a functioning computer at the time.

This is the first one. I was biking back from the library where I would 
apply for jobs because I also didn't have a functioning computer at the 
time. I was on my 
way home from the library when I put this album on. In New York, I 
would spend a couple of months obsessing over each David Bowie 
album in chronological order. This was the next one. I was immediately 
comforted by the sound of train tracks at the beginning because, for 
some reason, my parents paid for me to come back by train instead of a 
plane. I also associated with the line about cocaine because, in New 
York, my close friend and roommate had a bit of a problem, and I ended 
up doing quite a bit of it for free just by being around him. The memory 
I have associated with first hearing this album is riding by the gas 
station around here, looking at something being constructed, and 
thinking about how pavement would taste as I often did when riding. 
This was happening as the train sounds return, and Bowie starts 
singing, "The return of the thin white duke..."

Like Bowie, I would spend several months obsessing over an Ariel Pink 
album as I went through his discography, except, for Ariel's, I just kind 
of picked titles that spoke to me at that time of my life. At this point, I 
was feeling relatively hopeless and had listened to pretty much 
everything by him except this, which I got from a torrent of his albums. 
This album isn't on streaming; it was released locally in California on 
cassette; several versions exist. I have no clue how it was digitized. It's 
still not available to purchase anywhere, but most of the songs now 
appear in some form on different releases. It's an extremely queer 
album from an artist who's already an oddball. 
</p><p>
Sometimes I would just go riding 
aimlessly to be away from my family. I think when I left, they were 
fighting about me. There's a song called "Shower Me With Lipstick" 
where the guitar part sounds like the gears of a bike moving. A 
completely different version appeared on the album he released that 
year in 2015. It appears  on one track containing several songs titled 
"Stevie Storm." There's also a song on this track called "Tryin' to Tell Ya 
About Kinkaid" that I became re-obsessed with a couple of years later 
for a different reason, but at the time, I found the hyperpaced tempo 
really fun to bike to. The title song on the track is a cover of Harry Merry, 
which Ariel can be heard panting on. I have a distinct memory of riding 
down this street, listening to it at night, and feeling like a complete trash 
human. I can't remember the first time I actually put this record on, but I 
became gripped by it because of the very first track, "Bogalusa, 
Louisiana."

I first got into this album in undergrad. This time when I was listening to 
it, it was nighttime, and I was going to NSU's library because I 
remembered that it stayed open later than the public one. This might 
have been the same night I was listening to <i>Yas Dudette</i>. This location 
is about where I realized I didn't have my NSU library card on me, just 
as Manson was saying, "Hey! You're going the wrong way," and I turned 
around to go back towards my house. It's a really good album, if you can get past
everything else about Charles Manson. <br>I had an NSU card because I 
went to Nova High across the street, and, as a gifted and AP student, 
some teachers wanted us to check out a collegiate-level library to do 
research for something. I just remembered it was no longer in my wallet
because I removed it before moving to NY.

I started listening to this album because Ariel does a cover of "This 
Night Has Opened My Eyes" on <i>Yas Dudette</i>. Until this point, I hated 
The Smiths. I got a job in the mall at the Penguin store. It must have 
been just after the interview when I got the job; I was in the food court 
waiting for the bus looking up at the glass ceiling, noticing it was 
starting to rain right after hearing Morrissey croon, "The rain falls hard 
on a humdrum town..."

I was biking to the library again but stopping by Plantation Promenade 
first. I think I must have been 
depositing a check a the bank on the corner. I thought maybe, I was 
getting something from Publix, but I don't remember having a shopping 
bag. I was listening to this album and hearing tinny 
speaking parts on the first track, thinking about how it reminded me of 
early space travel or like Syd was trying to tell me some secret 
message, a warning maybe. I fell on my bike rather goofily.This happened the same day I was listening to 
<i>Saucerful of Secrets</i>. 
</p>

At some point between this and the <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i> 
memory, I was listening to 
this album, then through Central Park Pl to get to Broward. It was my day off 
from the mall, and I was going to the library to apply for more jobs. I 
wanted an entry-level position in copywriting, a job I was searching for 
since I moved to New York. I was passing the ramp for cars to exit the 
gas station listening to "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun." I 
remember seeing the back of the woman's ponytail as she was looking 
for traffic. Most people drive in Florida, so she didn't check the sidewalk 
before pulling out. The bike continued moving forward with me on it for a 
couple of sidewalk blocks before I crashed into the ground because she 
bent my rear tire. I sat up on the sidewalk and looked back as the car 
sped off. I wasn't wearing a helmet. But I was fine, maybe scrapped up a 
little. My mom came to pick me up. We threw away the bike on bulk 
pickup day.

This is the bus stop I would use to get to the mall. I started 
listening to <i>Bleach</i> again, an album I'd listened to since middle school. 
The line "You're in high school again" really resonated with me because 
I was living with my parents and taking the bus just like in high school. 
I also, "About a Girl" reminded me of how I was so broke before leaving NY the person I was hooking up with
had to pay for everything even though she was younger than me.

It was my day off at the mall, or the next day was my day off. A little tipsy, I 
disassociated for a moment and saw myself with a demon hovering over my right 
shoulder, gesturing to my right, thinking I was dying for a second 
before collecting myself and continuing to Walgreens. I was listening to 
Elliott Smith's self-titled. I can't remember the song.
</p>

I would sometimes walk to the Promenade to get lunch on my days off 
at the mall, and I would take this path behind the elementary school. I remember passing by this 
artificial lake and listening to <i>Either/Or</i> because the song "Alameda" is 
about walking, and the tempo matches a walking pace intentionally 
well. I remember relating to a line in "Rose Parade" about "ridiculous 
marching" around here while looking at the lake.</p>
`

var story10 = `
<p>
I had listened to tracks from this album a lot, but as a whole, it never 
really clicked until I moved back home. The title track was really 
speaking to me when I was walking back from the Promenade towards 
my little secret path. Ariel's recordings are intentionally poor in quality, 
so it's hard to understand what he's saying. I was thinking about how I 
was hooking up with a girl for a couple of months before moving back 
home. Interestingly enough, she was a Parsons student. I didn't realize until 
this moment he was saying, "I put my penis in a hole... Then I went back 
to the kingdom where I was buried." Ariel rarely provides official lyrics to 
his songs, and I'm convinced that sometimes when he does, they're not 
what he's actually saying on the track. It was really sunny out; I think hot 
as well. The ending is so epic.

It's a memory of listening to "My Name is Jonas" in the shower when I 
first realized he says, "The choo-choo train left right on time." I started 
listening to this album because it has "The Sweater Song" with the lines 
"if you want to destroy my sweater / hold this thread as I walk away," 
which resonated with me after I realized I left my jacket at this girl's 
apartment I was hooking up with in New York. I never attempted to 
recover it when I had the chance. I knew the song because it was 
popular when I was in middle school. I used to like some of Weezer's 
singles but never really listened to their albums. There's also a version 
of them performing it with a spoken word poet that I found in 
undergrad when I started getting into poetry as an adult.

I became obsessed with James Ferraro after he released <i>Cold</i> when I 
was in New York. I got into his instrumental work, particularly <i>Suki Girlz</i>, 
because it was so great to have on while reading. Somehow I didn't get 
around to hearing this album till after I moved back home. I remember 
listening to it in my mom's car in the parking lot of this shopping center 
after I got a job working as a dishwasher at a pizza place I had been 
going to since I was a little kid. This was before I started working at the 
mall. He says, "She called out / Fuck this mattress, can't do it." It made 
me think about throwing my mattress out on the street after my lease 
ended because I had no money. I was taking what I could carry to my 
friend's apartment to sleep on his couch, where I would live with him and 
his girlfriend for two months. At one point, he kicked me out to have a 
romantic night with her and wouldn't let me back in till 2 am. I went to 
different bars in the area, reading Norman Mailer's <i>Barbary Shore</i>.

I was reading something, I can't remember what specifically, but I was listening 
to Chopin on shuffle while lying on the couch, and the sun was in the perfect position to 
shine directly into my eyes.
